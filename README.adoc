= GetWebContextFromEJB

Several posts on CrackOverflow have wrestled with the issue of "how do I find files in the Web Context from an EJB"
without resolving the issue in a way that is both (almost) clean, and portable.

This demonstrates a portable, but slightly circuitous way, to get it.
The answer is simple, have a ServletContextListener get the path, and save it in
a static field in the EJB. No need for properties file nor System properties,
and no need to figure out the exact path!

Simple, and it works. At least: tested on WildFly 10.x.

Only tested in War deployment; I can not be bothered to create a legacy EAR deployment.

For more details, UTSL.
